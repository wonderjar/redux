 *
 * There should only be a single store in your app. To specify how different
 * parts of the state tree respond to actions, you may combine several reducers
 * into a single reducer function by using `combineReducers`.
 *
 * @param {Function} reducer A function that returns the next state tree, given
 * the current state tree and the action to handle.
 *
 * @param {any} [preloadedState] The initial state. You may optionally specify it
 * to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a
 * previously serialized user session.
 * If you use `combineReducers` to produce the root reducer function, this must be
 * an object with the same shape as `combineReducers` keys.
 *
 * @param {Function} [enhancer] The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it
 * to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware,
 * time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux
 * is `applyMiddleware()`.
 *
 * @returns {Store} A Redux store that lets you read the state, dispatch actions
 * and subscribe to changes.

   * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
   * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
   * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest

   * sessions, or use the time travelling `redux-devtools`. An action must have

   * string constants for action types.
